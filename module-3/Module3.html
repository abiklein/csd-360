       <p> Funny Frogs </p>

       <p> When my sister and I were kids, we loved to go to the swamp right
         next to our grandmother's house. There we would catch tadpoles,
         baby catfish, minnows, and <span id = "frogs"> _________ </span>.
       </p>

       <p> We were dedicated hunters, our feet bare and pants rolled up to
         our thighs so that we could tread the water more carefully and stealthily.
         During our minutes or hours of stalking, cups in hand, we would swipe in
         the water, check our catch, and stalk again until we either got hungry or bored.</p>

        <p>By the end of the day, my sister and I would be so thrilled with whatever
          <span id = "hull">______________________________ </span> we managed
         to get during our hunting spree, we failed to contain our excitement and could
         not wait to show our family. That day, our prize catch was a small frog.
       In preparation to show everyone, we placed him in a cup with a cap over the
     top that had a small hole so that he could breath.</p>

       <p>By the time we herded everyone together, our mom, grandma, aunt, and dad
         surrounded the cup, proud and eager to see what was inside. As the lid slowly
         opened, so did everyone lean forward to get a better look as to what was inside.
         As they leaned even closer, and the lid revealed the prize, suddenly,
         everyone froze with shock! The cup...was empty. Confused, my sister and I
         were trying to think of how the frog escaped. I turned to my grandma, feeling defeated,
         and gasped! <span id="frogReveal"> __________________ </span> As the little amphibian hopped away, unharmed,
       everyone laughed and the experience became a heartfelt memory.</p>
