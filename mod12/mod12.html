Module 12 Assignment

Program Description:
This is a redo of one of the programming assignments I previously did
and am not satisfied with the score. The assignment being redone is
the Module 3 Assignment:

A web page with a short story of an event in my life. Inside the story:
  - Four <span> tags containing a blank line (underscores).
  - Declare four variables holding the string inputs for these tags.
  - Buttons for each <span> tag that will replace the underscores when selected.
